  <!-- You are given a function, Pokeman, that takes three parameters,
pokemonName, pokemonType, an array of different pokemon attack methods,
pokemonAttackList.
1. Create three instances of the Pokemon and save them in a variable.
2. Using prototype properties, add the following methods:
• A method called callPokemon that will print the following: “I choose
you, <pokemon name>
• A method called attack that takes one parameter, an attack number,
that will print the specific attack method from the pokemonAttackList
array as the following: “<pokemon name> used <attack method>”
Call each pokemon with the 2 methods you created.
Here is the Pokemon function: -->

<script>
  function Pokemon(pokemonName, pokemonType, pokemonAttackList){
        this.name = pokemonName;
        this.type = pokemonType;
        this.attackList = pokemonAttackList;
}

const iftach = new Pokemon('iftach','water',['kick','flip'])
const yaar = new Pokemon('yaar','land',['punch','swip'])
const gali = new Pokemon('gali','fire',['hidden','yelling'])

// • A method called callPokemon that will print the following: “I choose
// you, <pokemon name>
  Pokemon.prototype.callPokemon = function (){ 
  
  return `I choose you, ${this.name}`
 };

//  • A method called attack that takes one parameter, an attack number,
// that will print the specific attack method from the pokemonAttackList
Pokemon.prototype.attack = function(num){
  return  `${this.name} used ${this.attackList[num]}`   ;
}
